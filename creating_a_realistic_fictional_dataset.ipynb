    "Having reviewed several articles on the topic, there seems to be many technical reasons for less than optimal fuel efficiency and the technical issues really comes down to maintenance or rather a lack thereof. A lot of the other factors mentioned, comes down to driving style and really reflects temperament and age related qualities. Other factors coming into play is the engine size of the vehicle, the distance of the commute and weather conditions, so all in all a reasonable set of conditions that can make an interesting dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an overwhelming amount of variables that can influence the overall fuel efficiency of a vehicle and very granular maintenance specifics like oil and fuel quality, tyres, air conditioner use and travel distance. The most basic gross factors influencing the outcome is the engine size, the weight or rather power to mass ratio, the speed, drive style, aerodynamics and mechanical resistance. \n",

    "\n",
    "Manufacturer order vary some between engine sizes since everyone does not manufacture the same ranges or engines, for example BMW and Mercedes dominates above the 2.4 category. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second aspect considered is the additional complexity introduced across 41 unique manufacturers to account for the engine sizes in the modelling of the generated dataset and the net effect overall is almost negligible as a result of the overall combined manufacturer popularity distribution, for example while Mercedes dominates the 2400 cc category, the overall representation of the manufacturer is only 2.39%, so roughly half this number around 1.2% that I will assign a bigger engine to the wrong manufacturer. All in all the set will balance as the cc distribution probability will still be accurately applied to the overall set. We will therefore not granularly distinguish engine size by manufacturer when generating the set, but rather use the overall set distribution as a guideline for all."

    "There is a lot of free data available to explore and shed light on global questions being asked and quite surprisingly easy to distil and arrive at clear conclusive answers to the questions, for example the distribution of male to female drives in Ireland. \n",
    "\n",
    "The random.choice option provides a very accurate and repeatable selection process for reproducing sets repeatable with non standard distribution types.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to make the wrong assumptions on limited datasets or demographically biased sets affecting choices for example the European taxation on bigger engines sizes compared to a US market where this is not applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is much more difficult than anticipated to generate meaningful representative datasets and a lot of time went into the background research and event testing code to achieve the end result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our perceptions are mostly wrong, for example I would have imagined a bigger dominance of male drivers when in fact it is very close to even. The other wrong perception was that small cars in more abundant on the roads when in fact the bigger engine sizes are more prevalent. "
