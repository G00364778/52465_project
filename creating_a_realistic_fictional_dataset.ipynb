A lot of the other factors mentioned, comes down to driving style and really reflects temperament and age related qualities. Other factors coming into play is the engine size of the vehicle, the distance of the commute and weather conditions, so all in all a reasonable set of conditions that can make an interesting dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Manufacturer order vary some between engine sizes since everyone does not manufacture the same ranges or engines, for example BMW and Mercedes dominates above the 2.4 category. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second aspect considered is the additional complexity introduced across 41 unique manufacturers to account for the engine sizes in the modelling of the generated dataset and the net effect overall is almost negligible as a result of the overall combined manufacturer popularity distribution, for example while Mercedes dominates the 2400 cc category, the overall representation of the manufacturer is only 2.39%, so roughly half this number around 1.2% that I will assign a bigger engine to the wrong manufacturer. All in all the set will balance as the cc distribution probability will still be accurately applied to the overall set. We will therefore not granularly distinguish engine size by manufacturer when generating the set, but rather use the overall set distribution as a guideline for all."

Still, trying any kind of distribution fails to yield the kinds of numbers repeatably to show the age distribution I would like to see. \n",
