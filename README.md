=======
## Problem statement 

-[ ] For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Speciﬁcally, in this project you should:
-[ ] Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diﬀerent variables. 
-[ ] Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. 
-[ ] Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. 
-[ ] Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook. 

Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own ﬁles. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section gives an example project idea.

## Submission Guidelines

### Research
-[ ] When conducting research into a topic, try to provide clear evidence that you developed new knowledge and skills while completing the assignment.
-[ ] While providing references is a necessity, it's also important that you demonstrate within your discussion how and why you considered and/or adopted the approaches of others to the problem.
-[ ] Make it clear why you adopted the approach you did, comparing it to the other approaches.
-[ ] Make sure to search online for various approaches to the problem, including other people's attempts at solving a similar problem. Summarise the results of this search in the project documentation.
-[ ] Use concepts and skills you learned in other subjects. The ability to tie all your various modules together is important.
### Development
-[ ] Consider your findings from researching the problem and use them to develop a plan for the project. A good plan will be evident in the layout and organisation of your code.
-[ ] Demonstrate how you made sure your software or project did what you said it would do at the start. For instance, you might consider devising some small tests that demonstrate that your submission provides the right outputs.
### Consistency
-[ ] You should draw up a plan for completing an assignment and make the plan evident in your submission. You should try to stick to this plan, and your project timeline should clearly demonstrate your work towards it.
### Documentation
-[ ] Consider various audiences when documenting your work. A technical audience, such as a lecturer, will require one style of description while a non-technical audience, such as a recruiter, will require another. Unfortunately, most of the time your work needs to speak to both.
